# 220c

### what is this?
this is a repo for the projects and assignments I worked on during 220c
which was a course about the C++ programming language

primarily we focused on some of the basics. writing classes, doing some
simple assignments. 

most of these assignments were supplemented through The C++ Programming
Language Fourth Edition C++ 11, because I forgot to check the language
version before buying the book and couldn't justify having more than
one.

### do you know c++ well?
not really. i know basics and some of the primitives I can talk about a
little bit of a deeper level. ultimately i took this class to learn the
basics and feel more comfortable in Go.

i'm not incredibly interested from a programming perspective to be
writing C++ everyday at the time of writing this (11/18/2025) however,
that could always change and if it does I will note that each time I
update the repository.
